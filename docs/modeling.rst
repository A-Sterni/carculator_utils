Modeling
========

This document describes the ``carculator`` model, assumptions
and inventories as exhaustively as possible.

``carculator`` is an open-source Python library. Its code is publicly
available via its `Github
repository <https://github.com/romainsacchi/carculator>`__.
You can also :download:`download an examples notebook <_static/resources/examples.zip>`, that guides new users into performing life cycle analyses.
Finally, there
is also an online graphical user interface available at
https://carculator.psi.ch.

Overview of ``carculator`` modules
----------------------------------

The main module ``model.py`` builds
the vehicles and delegates the calculation of motive and auxiliary
energy, noise, abrasion and exhaust emissions to satellite modules. Once
the vehicles are fully characterized, the set of calculated parameters
are passed to ``inventory.py`` which derives life cycle inventories and
calculates life cycle impact indicators. Eventually, these inventories
can be passed to ``export.py`` to be exported to various LCA software.


Vehicle modelling
-----------------

The modelling of vehicles along powertrain types, time and size classes
is described in this section. It is also referred to as *foreground*
modelling.

Size classes
************

Originally, ``carculator`` defines nine size classes, namely: Micro, Mini,
Small, Lower medium, Medium, Large, Medium SUV, Large SUV and Van,
according to the following criteria, adapted from the work of :cite:`ct-1099` and
shown in :ref:`Table 1 <table-1>`.

.. note::
    **Important remark**: Micro cars are not considered passenger cars in
    the Swiss and European legislation, but heavy quadricycles. We do
    however assimilate them to passenger cars. They are only modelled with a
    battery electric powertrain.

.. note::
    **Important remark**: Sport Utility Vehicles (SUV) are considered more
    as a body type than a size class. These vehicles have distinct
    aerodynamic properties, but their curb mass can be as light as that of a
    VW Polo or a Renault Clio (i.e., the Dacia Duster or Peugeot 2008 have a
    curb mass of 1'150 kg, against 1'100-1'300 kg for a VW Polo) or as heavy
    as a Mercedes Class E (i.e., the Audi Q7 has a minimum curb mass of
    2'000 kg, against 1'900 kg for a Mercedes Class E). To assess the
    impacts of very large SUV, the "Large SUV" category has been added, to
    represent SUV models with a very high curb mass (2'000 kg and above) and
    footprint.

Manufacture year and emission standard
**************************************

Several emission standards are considered. For simplicity, it is assumed
that the vehicle manufacture year corresponds to the registration year,
as shown in :ref:`Table 2 <table-2>`.

Size and mass-related parameters and modeling
*********************************************

The vehicle glider and its components (powertrain, energy storage, etc.)
are sized according to engine power, which itself is conditioned by the
curb mass of the vehicle. The curb mass of the vehicle is the sum of
the vehicle components (excluding the driver and possible cargo) as
represented in :ref:`Figure 1 <figure-1>`.

.. _figure-1:

.. figure:: /_static/img/image10.png
   :align: center

   *Figure 1: Vehicle mass calculation workflow*

This is an iterative process that stops when the curb mass of the
vehicle converges, as illustrated in :ref:`Figure 2 <figure-2>`.

.. _figure-2:

.. figure:: /_static/img/image11.png
   :align: center

   *Figure 2: Representation of the convergence of the sizing of the passenger car model*

Curb mass of the vehicle
++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. math::

    m_{curb} = sum(m_{glider}, m_{charger}, m_{conv},
            m_{inv}, m_{distr}, m_{comb}, m_{elec},\\
            m_{pwt}, m_{fcstack}, m_{fcauxbop}, m_{fcessbop},
            m_{battcell}, m_{battbop}, m_{fueltank}, m_{fuel})

With:

- :math:`m_{curb}` being the vehicle curb mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{fuel}` being the fuel mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{charger}` being the electric onboard charge mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{conv}` being the current converter, in kg
- :math:`m_{inv}` being the current AC/DC inverter, in kg
- :math:`m_{distr}` being the power distribution unit, in kg
- :math:`m_{comb}` being the combustion engine mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{elec}` being the electric motor mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{pwt}` being the powertrain mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{fcstack}` being the fuel cell stack mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{fcauxbop}` being the fuel cell auxiliary components mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{battcell}` being the battery cell mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{battbop}` being the battery auxiliary components mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{fcessbop}` being the fuel cell essential components mass, in kg
- :math:`m_{fueltank}` being the fuel tank mass, in kg


For each iteration, the tank-to-wheel energy consumption (i.e., the
motive energy minus any recuperated braking energy, together with the
needed auxiliary energy to power onboard electronics) of the vehicle is
calculated (i.e., to size the energy storage components, calculate the
fuel consumption, etc.), as described later in this section.

Cargo and driving mass of the vehicle
*************************************

The cargo mass of the vehicle is the sum of the cargo mass and the
passenger mass.

.. math::

    m_{cargo} = m_{cargo} + m_{passenger}

Where:

- :math:`m_{cargo}` is the cargo mass, in kg,
- and :math:`m_{passenger}` is the passenger mass.

The driving mass of the vehicle is the sum of the curb mass and the cargo mass.

.. math::

    m_{driving} = m_{curb} + m_{cargo}

Where:

- :math:`m_{curb}` is the curb mass, in kg,
- :math:`m_{cargo}` is the cargo mass, in kg,
- and :math:`m_{driving}` is the driving mass, in kg.

Light-weight rates
******************

Because the LCI dataset used to represent the glider of the vehicle is
not representative of today's' use of light-weighting materials, such as
aluminium (i.e., the dataset "glider for passenger cars" only contains
0.5% of its mass in aluminium) and advanced high strength steel (AHSS),
an amount of such light-weighting materials is introduced to substitute
conventional steel and thereby reduce the mass of the glider.

As further explained under the `Curb mass calibration`_ section, the mass of the glider is reduced
by replacing steel with a mix of aluminium and AHSS. Hence, the amounts
of light weighting materials introduced depend on the rate of glider
light weighting in 2020 relative to 2000 (approximately 11% for
combustion engine vehicles). The amount of aluminium introduced is
further cross-checked with the amounts indicated in :cite:`ct-1020` and listed in
:ref:`Table 3 <table-3>`, and comes in addition to the aluminium already contained in the
LCI datasets for the engine and transmission.

.. note::
    **Important remark:** The light-weighting rate is for most vehicles
    approximately 11% in 2020 relative to 2000. However, battery-equipped vehicles
    are an exception to this: Medium, Large and Large SUV vehicles have
    significantly higher light weighting rates to partially compensate for
    the additional mass of their batteries. In order to match the battery
    capacity and the curb mass of their respective size class, their light
    weighting rate is increased to 14, 28 and 30%, respectively. This trend
    is also confirmed by :cite:`ct-1020`, showing that battery electric vehicles have
    85% more aluminium than combustion engine vehicles, partly going into
    the battery management system, and partly going into the chassis to
    compensate for the extra mass represented by the battery.

These light-weighting rates have been fine adjusted to match the curb
mass of a given size class, while preserving the battery capacity. For
example, in the case of the Large SUV, its curb mass should
approximately be 2'200 kg, with an 80 kWh battery weighting 660 kg
(e.g., Jaguar i-Pace). This is possible with a 30% light weighting rate,
introducing approximately 460 kg of aluminium in the chassis (which
matches roughly with the value given for an Audi e-Tron in :ref:`Table 3 <table-3>`) and
1'008 kg of AHSS, in lieu of 2'034 kg of regular steel.

Curb mass calibration
*********************

The final curb mass obtained for each vehicle is calibrated against the
European Commission's database for CO\ :sub:`2` emission tests for
passenger cars (hereafter called EC-CO2-PC) using the NEDC/WLTP driving
cycles :cite:`ct-1025`. Each vehicle registered in the European Union is tested and
several of the vehicle attributes are registered (e.g., dimension, curb
mass, driving mass, CO\ :sub:`2` emissions, etc.). This has represented
about 15+ million vehicles per year for the past five years.

The figure below shows such calibration for the years 2010, 2013, 2016,
2018, 2019 and 2020 -- to be representative of EURO-4, -5, 6 a/b, 6-c
and 6-d-temp vehicles. No measurements are available for 2003 (EURO-3)
or 2021 (EURO-6-d). After cleaning the data from the EC-CO2-PC database,
it represents 27 million points to calibrate the curb mass of the
vehicles with. Green vertical bars represent the span of 50% of the curb
mass distribution, and the red dots are the curb mass values modeled by
``carculator``.

Energy consumption
******************

The energy consumption model of ``carculator`` calculates the energy
required at the wheels by considering different types of resistance.
Some of these resistances are related to the vehicle size class. For
example, the frontal area of the vehicle influences the aerodynamic
drag. Also, the kinetic energy to overcome the vehicle's inertia is
influenced by the mass of the vehicle (which partially correlates to
with the size class or body type), but also by the acceleration required
by the driving cycle. Other resistances, such as the climbing effort,
are instead determined by the driving cycle (but the vehicle mass also
plays a role here). Once the energy required at the wheels is known, the
model goes on to calculate the energy required at the tank level by
considering additional losses along the drive train (i.e., axles,
gearbox, and engine losses). The different types of resistance
considered are depicted in :ref:`Figure 4 <figure-4>`, and the module calculation workflow
is presented in :ref:`Figure 5 <figure-5>`.

Powertrains that are partially or fully electrified have the possibility
to recuperate a part of the energy spent for propulsion during
deceleration or braking. The round-trip battery energy loss (which is
the sum of the charge and discharge battery loss, described in :ref:`Figure 4 <figure-4>`)
is subtracted from the recuperated energy. For hybrid vehicles (i.e.,
HEV-p, HEV-d), this allows to downsize the combustion engine and improve
the overall tank-to-wheel efficiency, as explained in :cite:`ct-1012`.

Finally, for each second of the driving cycle, the auxiliary power load
is considered. It comprises an auxiliary base power load (i.e., to
operate onboard electronics), as well as the power load from heating and
cooling. While electric vehicles provide energy from the battery to
supply heating and cooling (i.e., thereby decreasing the available
energy available for traction), combustion vehicles recover enough waste
engine heat to supply adequate heating. The values considered for the
auxiliary base power load and for the power load for heating and cooling
are presented in :ref:`Table 5 <table-5>`. These values are averaged over the whole year,
based on maximum demand and share of operation.

.. math::

    P_{aux} = P_{base} + (P_{heating} \times D_{heating}) + (P_{cooling} \times D_{cooling})

Where:

- :math:`P_{base}` is the auxiliary base power load [W],
- :math:`P_{heating}` is the power load for heating [W],
- :math:`P_{cooling}` is the power load for cooling [W],
- :math:`D_{heating}` is the demand for heating [0-1] (=0 for non-electric vehicles),
- and :math:`D_{cooling}` is the demand for cooling [0-1].

To convert it into an energy consumption :math:`F_{aux}` [kj/km],
the auxiliary power load is multiplied by the time of the driving cycle
and divided by the distance driven:

.. math::

    F_{aux} = \frac{P_{aux} \times T}{D}

Where: :math:`T` is the driving cycle time [seconds] and D is the distance [m].

.. note::
    **Important remark:** Micro cars are not equipped with an air
    conditioning system. Hence, their cooling energy requirement is set to
    zero.

A driving cycle is used to calculate the tank-to-wheel energy required
by the vehicle to drive over one kilometer. For example, the WLTC
driving cycle comprises a mix of urban, sub-urban and highway driving.
It is assumed representative of average Swiss and European driving
profile - although this would likely differ in the case of intensive
mountain driving.

:ref:`Figure 6 <figure-6>` exemplifies such calculation for a medium battery electric
passenger car manufactured in 2020, using the WLTC driving cycle.

.. _figure-6:

.. _figure-7:

.. figure:: /_static/img/image17.png
   :align: center

   *Figure 7: Driving cycle and related parameters*

So, the tank-to-wheel energy consumption :math:`F_{ttw}` is the sum of the motive energy and the
energy required to power auxiliary equipment. It is calculated as:

.. math::

    F_{ttw} = F_{motive} + F_{aux}

Where:

- :math:`F_{motive}` is the motive energy,
- and :math:`F_{aux}` is the auxiliary energy.

There are no fuel consumption measurements available for fuel cell
vehicles. Values found in the literature and from manufacturers data are
used to approximate the engine and transmission efficiency and to
calibrate the final energy consumption.

For diesel and gasoline hybrid vehicles, which are ICE vehicles equipped
with a small electric motor to allow for energy recuperation and
reducing the engine size, the drivetrain and engine efficiency are based
on :cite:`ct-1012,ct-1073`. The amount of energy recuperated is determined by the driving
cycle as well as the round-trip efficiency between the wheels and the
engine and cannot be superior to the power output of the engine. Further
on, the share of recuperated energy over the total negative motive
energy (i.e., the braking or deceleration energy) is used as a
discounting factor for brake wear particle emissions.

Engine and transmission efficiencies for the different powertrains are
fine-tuned until it aligns reasonably well with the fuel consumption
values from the EC-CO2-PC database, as shown in :ref:`Figure 8 <figure-8>`.

Electric energy storage
***********************

Battery electric vehicles can use different battery chemistry (Li-ion
NMC, Li-ion LFP, Li-ion NCA and Li-LTO) depending on the manufacturer's
preference or the location of the battery supplier. Unless specified
otherwise, all battery types are produced in China, as several sources,
among which BloombergNEF :cite:`ct-1105`, seem to indicate that more than 75% of the
world's cell capacity is manufactured there.

Accordingly, the electricity mix used for battery cells manufacture and
drying, as well as the provision of heat are assumed to be
representative of the country (i.e., the corresponding providers are
selected from the LCI background database).

The battery-related parameters considered in ``carculator`` for 2020 are
shown in :ref:`Table 6 <table-6>`. For LFP batteries, "blade battery" or "cell-to-pack"
battery configurations are considered, as introduced by CATL :cite:`ct-1113` and BYD
:cite:`ct-1049`, two major LFP battery suppliers in Asia. This greatly increases
the cell-to-pack ratio and the gravimetric energy density at the pack
level.

Overall, the gravimetric energy density values at the cell and system
levels presented in Table 6 are considered conservative: some
manufacturers perform significantly better than the average, and these
values tend to change rapidly over time, as it is being the focus of
much R&D. Hence, by 2050, the gravimetric energy density of NMC and NCA
cells are expected to reach 0.5 kWh/kg, while that of LFP cells plateaus
at 0.15 kWh/kg (but benefits from a high cell-to-pack ratio)..

.. note::
    The NMC battery cell used by default corresponds to a so-called NMC 6-2-2 chemistry: it exhibits three times the mass amount of *Ni*
    compared to *Mn*, and *Co*, while *Mn* and *Co* are present in equal amount. Development aims at reducing the content of Cobalt and increasing the
    Nickel share. A selection of other chemistry types can be chosen from.


On account that:

- the battery cycle life values were obtained in the context of an experiment :cite:`ct-1063`,
- with loss of 20% of the initial capacity, the battery may still
  provide enough energy to complete the intended route,
  cycle life values for NMC and NCA battery chemistry are corrected by +50%.

.. note::
    **Important assumption**: The environmental burden associated with the
    manufacture of spare batteries is entirely allocated to the vehicle use.
    The number of battery replacements is rounded up.

:ref:`Table 7 <table-7>` gives an overview of the number of battery replacements assumed
for the different battery electric vehicles in ``carculator``.

Users are encouraged to test the sensitivity of end-results on the
number of battery replacements.

The number of battery replacement is calculated as follows:

.. math::

    n_{batt_repl} = \frac{L_{veh}}{L_{batt}} - 1

Where:

- :math:`L_{veh}` is the lifetime of the vehicle [km],
- and :math:`L_{batt}` is the lifetime of the battery [km].

Liquid and gaseous energy storage
*********************************

The oxidation energy stored in liquid fuel tanks is calculated as:

.. math::

    E_{oxid} = m_{fuel} \times E_{lhv}

Where:

- :math:`m_{fuel}` is the mass of the fuel [kg],
- and :math:`E_{lhv}` is the lower heating value of hte fuel [MJ/kg].

The fuel tank mass is calculated as:

.. math::

    m_{tank} = m_{fuel} \times m_{tank unit}

Where: :math:`m_{tank unit}` being the tank mass per unit of energy [kg/MJ].

.. note::
    The tank mass per unit of energy is different for liquid fuels (gasoline,
    diesel), and for gaseous fuels (compressed gas, hydrogen). Also, compressed gas tanks
    store at 200 bar, while hydrogen tanks store at 700 bar.

Fuel cell stack
***************

All fuel cell electric vehicles use a proton exchange membrane
(PEM)-based fuel cell system.

:ref:`Table 8 <table-8>` lists the specifications of the fuel cell stack and system used
in ``carculator`` in 2020. The durability of the fuel cell stack,
expressed in hours, is used to determine the number of replacements
needed - the expected kilometric lifetime of the vehicle as well as the
average speed specified by the driving cycle gives the number of hours
of operation. The environmental burden associated with the manufacture
of spare fuel cell systems is entirely allocated to vehicle use as no
reuse channels seem to be implemented for fuel cell stacks at the
moment.

The fuel cell system efficiency :math:`r_{fcsys}` is calculated as:

.. math::

    r_{fcsys} = \frac{r_{fcstack}}{r_{fcown}}

Where:

- :math:`r_{fcstack}` is the fuel cell stack efficiency [%],
- and :math:`r_{fcown}` is the rate of auto consumption [%].

For reference, the rate of auto-consumption in 2020 for a fuel cell system is 15% (i.e., 15% of the power produced by
the fuel cell system is consumed by it).

The fuel cell system power :math:`P_{fcsys}` is calculated as:

.. math::

    P_{fcsys} = P_{veh} \times r_{fcshare} \times r_{fcown}

Where:

- :math:`P_{veh}` is the vehicle engine power
- and :math:`r_{fcshare}` is the fuel cell system power relative to the vehicle engine power [%].

Finally, the fuel cell stack mass is calculated as:

.. math::

    m_{fcstack} = 0.51 [kg/kW] \times P_{fcsys} \times \frac{800 [mW/cm^2]}{A_{fc}}

Where:

- :math:`P_{fcsys}` is the fuel cell system power [kW],
- :math:`A_{fc}` is the fuel cell fuel cell power area density [kW/cm2],
- and :math:`m_{fcstack}` is the fuel cell stack mass [kg].


.. note::
    **Important remark:** Although fuel cell electric vehicles have a small
    battery to enable the recuperation of braking energy, etc., we model
    it as a power battery, not a storage battery.
    For example, the Toyota Mirai is equipped with a 1.6 kWh
    nickel-based battery.

The battery power is calculated as:

.. math::

    P_{batt} = P_{fcsys} \times (1 - r_{fcsys})

Where:

- :math:`P_{fcsys}` is the fuel cell system power [kW],
- and :math:`r_{fcshare}` is the fuel cell system power share [%].

The number of fuel cell replacements is based on the average distance driven
with a set of fuel cells given their lifetime expressed in hours of use.
The number is replacement is rounded *up* as we assume no allocation of burden
with a second life. It is hence is calculated as:

.. math::

    n_{fcrep} = \frac{L_{veh}}{V_{avg} \times L_{fc}} - 1

Where:

- :math:`L_{veh}` is the lifetime of the vehicle [km],
- :math:`V_{avg}` is the average speed of the driving cycle selected [km/h],
- and :math:`L_{fc}` is the fuel cell lifetime in hours [h].

Light-weighting
***************

The automotive industry has been increasingly using light weighting
materials to replace steel in engine blocks, chassis, wheels rims and
powertrain components :cite:`ct-1020`. However, vehicles light weighting has not led
to an overall curb mass reduction for passenger cars and trucks, as
additional safety equipment compensate for it. According to :cite:`ct-1053`,
passenger cars in the EU in 2016 were on average 10% heavier than in
2000.

The dataset used to represent the chassis of passenger cars (i.e.,
"glider, for passenger car") does not reflect today's use of light
weighting materials, such as aluminium and advanced high strength steel
(AHSS).

A report from the Steel Recycling Institute :cite:`ct-1082` indicates that every
kilogram of steel in a car glider can be substituted by 0.75 kilogram of
AHSS or 0.68 kilogram of aluminium. Looking at the material composition
of different car models three years apart, :cite:`ct-1041` show that steel is in
fact increasingly replaced by a combination of both aluminium and AHSS.
However, they also show that the use of AHSS is generally preferred to
aluminium as its mass reduction-to-cost ratio is preferable.

Hence, it is considered that, for a given mass reduction to reach,
two-third of the mass reduction comes from using AHSS, and one third
comes from using aluminium. This means that one kilogram of mass
reduction is achieved by replacing 3.57 kilogram of steel by:

-  1.76 kilogram of AHSS
-  0.8 kilogram of aluminium

Additionally, additional efforts is made to ensure that the final
aluminium content in the chassis corresponds to what is actually found
in current passenger car models, according to :cite:`ct-1020`.

While ecoinvent v.3.8 has a LCI dataset for the supply of aluminium, it
is not the case for AHSS. However, an LCA report from the World Steel
Institute :cite:`ct-1110` indicates that AHSS has a similar carbon footprint than
conventional primary low-alloyed steel from a basic oxygen furnace route
(i.e., 2.3 kg CO\ :sub:`2`-eq./kg). We therefore use conventional steel
to represent the use of AHSS.

The amount of light-weighting obtained from the use of light-weighting
materials is:

:math:`\Delta m_{glider} = m_{glider} \times r_{lightweighting}`

Where:

- :math:`\Delta m_{steel}` is the mass reduction of the glider [kg],
- and :math:`r_{lightweighting}` is the light-weighting ratio [%].

Sizing of onboard energy storage
********************************

Sizing of battery
+++++++++++++++++

The sizing of batteries for battery electric vehicles is conditioned by
the battery mass, which is defined as an input parameter for each size
class. The battery masses given for the different size classes are
presented in :ref:`Figure 9 <figure-9>` using the battery chemistry NMC, and is based on
representative battery storage capacities available today on the market
- which are represented in relation to the curb mass. The data is
collected from the vehicle's registry of Touring Club Switzerland.

.. _figure-9:

   :align: center

   *Figure 9: Energy storage capacity for current battery electric cars, shown in relation to curb mass. Red dots are the energy storage capacities used for Small, Medium and Large battery electric vehicles in ``carculator``*

Seventy percent of the overall battery mass is assumed to be represented
by the battery cells in the case of NMC and NCA batteries. Given the
energy density of the battery cell considered, this yields the storage
capacity of the battery. A typical depth of discharge of 80% is used to
calculate the available storage capacity.

Hence, the battery cell mass is calculated as:

.. math::

    m_{cell} = m_{pack} \times s_{cell}

Where:

- :math:`m_{pack}` is the mass of the pack,
- and :math:`s_{cell}` is the cell-to-pack ratio.

And the electricity stored in the battery is calculated as:

.. math::

    E_{battery} = m_{cell} \times C_{cell}

Where:

- :math:`E_{battery}` being battery capacity [kWh],
- :math:`C_{cell}` is the cell energy density [kg/kWh],
- and :math:`m_{cell}` is the cell mass [kg].

By deduction, the balance of plant mass is:

.. math::

    m_{BoP} = m_{battery} - m_{cell}

Where:

- :math:`m_{battery}` is the mass of the battery [kg],
- and :math:`m_{cell}` is the cell mass [kg].

Finally, the range autonomy is calculated as:

.. math::

    R_{autonomy} = \frac{C_{battery} \times r_{discharge}}{F_{ttw}}

Where:

- :math:`C_{battery}` is the battery capacity [kWh],
- :math:`r_{discharge}` is the discharge depth [%],
- and :math:`F_{ttw}` is the tank-to-wheel energy consumption [kWh/km].


Similarly, plug-in hybrid vehicles are dimensioned to obtain an energy
storage capacity of the battery that corresponds with the capacity of
models available today. The sizing of the battery is similar to what is
described above for battery electric vehicles. The energy storage
capacity of the battery is particularly important for plugin hybrid
vehicles, as it conditions the electric utility factor (the share of
kilometers driven in battery-depleting mode) which calculation is
described in the next section.

Electric utility factor
***********************

Diesel and gasoline plugin hybrid vehicles are modeled as a composition
of an ICE vehicle and a battery electric vehicle to the extent
determined by the share of km driven in battery-depleting mode (also
called "electric utility factor"). This electric utility factor is
calculated based on a report from the ICCT :cite:`ct-1062`, which provides measured
electricity utility factors for 6'000 PHEV *private* owners in Germany
in relation to the vehicle range in battery-depleting mode.

A first step consists in determining the energy consumption of the PHEV
in electric mode as well as its battery size, in order to know its range
autonomy. When the range autonomy is known, the electric utility factor
is interpolated based on the data presented in :ref:`Table 11 <table-11>`.

   +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

Once the electric utility factor :math:`U` is known, it is used as a partitioning
ratio to compose the vehicle between the PHEV in combustion mode, and the PHEV in electric mode,
where:

.. math::

    F_{ttw_phev} = (F_{ttw_phev_e} \times U) + (F_{ttw_phev_c} \times (1 - U))

.. math::

    m_{curb_phev} = (m_{curb_phev_e} \times U) + (m_{curb_phev_c} \times (1 - U))

Where:

- :math:`F_{ttw_phev_e}` is the tank-to-wheel energy consumption [kWh/km] of the electric PHEV,
- :math:`F_{ttw_phev_c}` is the tank-to-wheel energy consumption [kk/km] of the combustion PHEV,
- :math:`m_{curb_phev_e}` is the curb weight [kg] of the electric PHEV,
- and :math:`m_{curb_phev_c}` is the curb weight [kg] of the combustion PHEV.


Inventory modelling
-------------------

Once the vehicles are modeled, the calculated parameters of each of them
is passed to the inventory.py calculation module to derive inventories.
When the inventories for the vehicle and the transport are calculated,
they can be normalized by the kilometric lifetime (i.e., vehicle-kilometer)
or by the kilometric multiplied by the passenger occupancy (i.e., passenger-kilometer).

Road demand
***********

The demand for construction and maintenance of roads and road-related
infrastructure is calculated on the following basis:

-  Road construction: 5.37e-7 meter-year per kg of vehicle mass per km.
-  Road maintenance: 1.29e-3 meter-year per km, regardless of vehicle mass.

The driving mass of the vehicle consists of the mass of the vehicle in
running condition (including fuel) in addition to the mass of passengers
and cargo, if any. Unless changed, the passenger mass is 75 kilograms,
and the average occupancy is 1.6 persons per vehicle.

The demand rates used to calculate the amounts required for road
construction and maintenance (based on vehicle mass per km and per km,
respectively) are taken from :cite:`ct-1091`.

Because roads are maintained by removing surface layers older than those
that are actually discarded, road infrastructure disposal is modeled in
ecoinvent as a renewal rate over the year in the road construction
dataset.

Fuel properties
***************

For all vehicles with an internal combustion engine, carbon dioxide
(CO\ :sub:`2`) and sulfur dioxide (SO\ :sub:`2`) emissions are
calculated based on the fuel consumption of the vehicle and the carbon
and sulfur concentration of the fuel observed in Switzerland and Europe.
Sulfur concentration values are sourced from HBEFA 4.1 :cite:`ct-1058`. Lower
heating values and CO\ :sub:`2` emission factors for fuels are sourced
from p.86 and p.103 of :cite:`ct-1096`. The fuel properties shown in :ref:`Table 12 <table-12>` are
used for fuels purchased in Switzerland.

Because large variations are observed in terms of sulfur concentration
in biofuels, similar values than that of conventional fuels are used.

Exhaust emissions
*****************

Emissions of regulated and non-regulated substances during driving are
approximated using emission factors from HBEFA 4.1 :cite:`ct-1058`. Emission
factors are typically given in gram per km. Emission factors
representing free flowing driving conditions and urban and rural traffic
situations are used. Additionally, cold start emissions as well as
running, evaporation and diurnal losses are accounted for, also sourced
from HBEFA 4.1 :cite:`ct-1058`.


For vehicles with an internal combustion engine, the sulfur
concentration values in the fuel can slightly differ across regions -
although this remains rather limited within Europe. The values provided
by HBEFA 4.1 are used for Switzerland, France, Germany, Austria and
Sweden. For other countries, values from :cite:`ct-1118` are used.

   +---------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+

The amount of sulfur dioxide released by the vehicle over one km [kg/km] is calculated as:

.. math::

        SO_2 = r_{S} \times F_{fuel} \times (64/32)

Where:

- :math:`r_{S}` is the sulfur content per kg of fuel [kg SO2/kg fuel],
- :math:`F_{fuel}` is the fuel consumption of the vehicle [kg/km],
- and :math:`64/32` is the ratio between the molar mass of SO2 and the molar mass of O2.

Country-specific fuel blends are sourced from the IEA's Extended World
Energy Balances database :cite:`ct-1045`. By default, the biofuel used is assumed
to be produced from biomass residues (i.e., second-generation fuel):
fermentation of crop residues for bioethanol, esterification of used
vegetable oil for biodiesel and anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge for
bio-methane.

A number of fuel-related emissions other than CO\ :sub:`2` and
SO\ :sub:`2` are considered, using the HBEFA 4.1 database :cite:`ct-1058`.

Six sources of emissions are considered:

-  Exhaust emissions: emissions from the combustion of fuel during
   operation. Their concentration relates to the fuel consumption and
   the emission standard of the vehicle.
-  Cold start emissions: emissions when starting the engine. The factor
   is given in grams per engine start. 2.3 engine starts per day are
   considered :cite:`ct-1096` and an annual mileage of 12'000 km.
-  Diurnal emissions: evaporation of the fuel due to a temperature
   increase of the vehicle. The factor is given in grams per day.
   Emissions are distributed evenly along the driving cycle, based on an
   annual mileage of 12'000 km per year.
-  Hot soak emissions: evaporative emissions occurring after the vehicle
   has been used. The factor is given in grams per trip. The emission is
   added at the end of the driving cycle.
-  In addition, running loss emissions: emissions related to the
   evaporation of fuel (i.e., not combusted) during operation. The
   factor is given in grams per km. Emissions are distributed evenly
   along the driving cycle.
-  Other non-exhaust emissions: brake, tire road wear and re-suspended
   road dust emissions, as well as emissions of refrigerant.

.. _figure-10:

   :align: center

   *Figure 10: Representation of the different sources of emission other than exhaust emissions*

For exhaust emissions, factors based on the fuel consumption are derived
by comparing emission data points for different traffic situations
(i.e., grams emitted per vehicle-km) for in a free flowing driving
situation, with the fuel consumption corresponding to each data point
(i.e., MJ of fuel consumed per km), as illustrated in :ref:`Figure 11 <figure-11>` for a
diesel-powered engine. The aim is to obtain emission factors expressed
in grams of substance emitted per MJ of fuel consumed, to be able to
model emissions of passenger cars of different sizes and fuel efficiency
and for different driving cycles.

Hence, the emission of substance i at second s of the driving cycle is
calculated as follows:

.. math::

    E(i,s) = F_ttw(s) \times X(i, e)

Where:

- :math:`E(i,s)` is the emission of substance i at second s of the driving cycle,
- :math:`F_ttw(s)` is the fuel consumption of the vehicle at second s,
- and :math:`X(i, e)` is the emission factor of substance i in the given driving conditions.

To that, we add the following terms:

- Cold start emissions on the first second of the driving cycle
- Evaporation emissions: on the last second of the driving cycle
- Diurnal and running losses: distributed evenly over the driving cycle

.. note::
    **Important remark**: the degradation of anti-pollution systems for
    diesel and gasoline cars (i.e., catalytic converters) is accounted for
    as indicated by HBEFA, by applying a degradation factor on the emission
    factors for CO, HC and NO\ :sub:`x` for gasoline cars, as well as on CO
    and NO\ :sub:`x` for diesel cars. These factors are shown in :ref:`Table 15 <table-15>`
    for passenger cars with a mileage of 200'000 km, which is the default
    lifetime value in ``carculator``. The degradation factor corresponding to
    half of the vehicle kilometric lifetime is used, to obtain a
    lifetime-weighted average degradation factor.

   *Figure 11: Relation between emission factor and fuel consumption for a diesel-powered passenger car. Dots represent HBEFA 4.1 emission factors for different traffic situation for a diesel engine, for different emission standards*

However, as :ref:`Figure 11 <figure-11>` shows, the relation between amounts emitted and
fuel consumption is not always obvious and using a linear relation
between amounts emitted and fuel consumption can potentially be
incorrect. In addition, emissions of ammonia (NH\ :sub:`3`) and Nitrous
oxides (N\ :sub:`2`\ O) seem to be related to the emission standard
(e.g., use of urea solution) and engine temperature rather than the fuel
consumption.

To confirm that such approach does not yield kilometric emissions too
different from the emission factors per vehicle-kilometer proposed by
HBEFA 4.1, :ref:`Figure 12 <figure-12>` compares the emissions obtained by ``carculator``
using the WLTC driving cycle over 1 vehicle-km (red dots) with the
distribution of the emission factors for different traffic situations
(green box-and-whiskers) as well as the traffic situation-weighted
average emission factor (yellow dots) given by HBEFA 4.1 for different
emission standards for a medium diesel-powered passenger car.

There is some variation across traffic situations, but the emissions
obtained remain, for most substances, within the 50% of the distributed
HBEFA values across traffic situations. Also, the distance between the
modeled emission and the traffic-situation-weighted average is
reasonable.

.. note::
    **Important remark**: NO\ :sub:`x` emissions for emission standards
    EURO-4 and 5 tend to be under-estimated compared to HBEFA's values. It
    is also important to highlight that, in some traffic situations, HBEFA's
    values show that emissions of CO, HC, NMHC and PMs for vehicles with
    early emission standards can be much higher that what is assumed in
    ``carculator``. There is overall a good agreement between traffic
    situation-weighted average emission factors and those used in
    ``carculator``.

Non-exhaust emissions
*********************

A number of emission sources besides exhaust emissions are considered.
They are described in the following sub-sections.

Engine wear emissions
+++++++++++++++++++++

Metals and other substances are emitted during the combustion of fuel
because of engine wear. These emissions are scaled based on the fuel
consumption, using the emission factors listed in :ref:`Table 17 <table-17>`, sourced from
:cite:`ct-1028`.

Abrasion emissions
++++++++++++++++++

We distinguish four types of abrasion emissions, besides engine wear
emissions:

-  brake wear emissions: from the wearing out of brake drums, discs and pads
-  tires wear emissions: from the wearing out of rubber tires on the asphalt
-  road wear emissions: from the wearing out of the road pavement

and re-suspended road dust: dust on the road surface that is
re-suspended as a result of passing traffic, "due either to shear forces
at the tire/road surface interface, or air turbulence in the wake of a
moving vehicle" :cite:`ct-1007`.

:cite:`ct-1007` provides an approach for estimating the mass and extent of these
abrasion emissions. They propose to disaggregate the abrasion emission
factors presented in the EMEP's 2019 Emission inventory guidebook :cite:`ct-1028`
for two-wheelers, passenger cars, buses and heavy good vehicles, to
re-quantify them as a function of vehicle mass, but also traffic
situations (urban, rural and motorway). Additionally, they present an
approach to calculate re-suspended road dust according to the method
presented in :cite:`ct-1103` - such factors are not present in the EMEP's 2019
Emission inventory guidebook - using representative values for dust load
on European roads.

The equation to calculate brake, tire, road and re-suspended road dust
emissions is the following:

.. math::

    EF=b.W^{\frac{1}{c}}

With:

-  :math:`EF` being the emission factor, in mg per vehicle-kilometer
-  :math:`W` being the vehicle mass, in tons
-  :math:`b` and :math:`c` being regression coefficients, whose values are presented in :ref:`Table 18 <table-18>`.

The respective amounts of brake and tire wear emissions in urban, rural
and motorway driving conditions are weighted, to represent the driving
cycle used. The weight coefficients sum to 1 and the coefficients
considered are presented in :ref:`Table 19 <table-19>`. They have been calculated by
analyzing the speed profile of each driving cycle, with the exception of
two-wheelers, for which no driving cycle is used (i.e., the energy
consumption is from reported values) and where simple assumptions are
made in that regard instead.

   +----------------------+----------------------+------------+------------+------------+

Finally, for electric and (plugin) hybrid vehicles, the amount of brake
wear emissions is reduced. This reduction is calculated as the ratio
between the sum of energy recuperated by the regenerative braking system
and the sum of negative resistance along the driving cycle. The logic is
that the amount of negative resistance that could not be met by the
regenerative braking system needs to be met with mechanical brakes. This
is illustrated in :ref:`Figure 13 <figure-13>`, where the distance between the recuperated
energy and the total negative motive energy corresponds to the amount of
energy that needs to be provided by mechanical brakes. :ref:`Table 20 <table-20>` lists
such reduction actors for the different powertrains.

The sum of PM 2.5 and PM 10 emissions is used as the input for the
ecoinvent v.3.x LCI datasets indicated in :ref:`Table 21 <table-21>`.

Finally, we assume that the composition of the re-suspended road dust is
evenly distributed between brake, road and tire wear particles.

:ref:`Figure 14 <figure-14>` shows the calculated abrasion emissions for passenger cars in
mg per vehicle-kilometer, following the approach presented above.

.. _figure-14:

.. figure:: /_static/img/image24.png
   :align: center

   *Figure 14: Total particulate matter emissions (<2.5 µm and 2.5-10 µm) in mg per vehicle-kilometer for passenger cars*

Re-suspended road dust emissions are assumed to be evenly composed of
brake wear (33.3%), tire wear (33.3%) and road wear (33.3%) particles.

Refrigerant emissions
+++++++++++++++++++++

The use of refrigerant for onboard air conditioning systems is
considered for passenger cars until 2021. The supply of refrigerant gas R134a is
accounted for. Similarly, the leakage of the refrigerant is also
considered. For this, the calculations from :cite:`ct-1093` are used. Such emission
is included in the transportation dataset of the corresponding vehicle.
The overall supply of refrigerant amounts to the initial charge plus the
amount leaked throughout the lifetime of the vehicle, both listed in
:ref:`Table 22 <table-22>` This is an important aspect, as the refrigerant gas R134a has
a Global Warming potential of 2'400 kg CO\ :sub:`2`-eq./kg released in
the atmosphere.

.. _table-22:

.. table:: Table 22: Use and loss of refrigerant gas for onboard air conditioning systems

   +----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
   |                                              | Passenger cars (except Micro)      |
   +==============================================+====================================+
   | Initial charge [kg per vehicle lifetime]     | 0.55                               |
   +----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
   | Lifetime loss [kg per vehicle lifetime]      | 0.75                               |
   +----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+

.. note::
    **Important assumption**: It is assumed that electric and plug-in
    electric vehicles also use a compressor-like belt-driven air
    conditioning system, relying on the refrigerant gas R134a. In practice,
    an increasing, but still minor, share of electric vehicles now use a
    (reversible) heat pump to provide cooling.

.. note::
    **Important remark:** Micro cars do not have an air conditioning system.
    Hence, no supply or leakage of refrigerant is considered for those.

.. note:: **Important remark:** After 2021, R134a is no longer used.

Noise emissions
***************

Noise emissions along the driving cycle of the vehicle are quantified
using the method developed within the CNOSSOS project :cite:`ct-1094`, which are
expressed in joules, for each of the 8 octaves. Rolling and propulsion
noise emissions are quantified separately.

The sound power level of rolling noise is calculated using:

.. image:: /_static/img/image25.png
   :align: center

With:

- :math:`v_m` being the instant speed given by the driving cycle, in km/h
- :math:`v_{ref}` being the reference speed of 70 km/h
- and :math:`A_{P,i,m}` and :math:`B_{P,i,m}` are unit-less and given in :ref:`Table 23 <table-23>`.

The propulsion noise level is calculated using:

With:

- :math:`v_m` being the instant speed given by the driving cycle, in km/h
- :math:`v_{ref}` being the reference speed of 70 km/h

A correction factor for battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles
is applied, and is sourced from :cite:`ct-1119`. Also, electric vehicles are added
a warning signal of 56 dB at speed levels below 20 km/h. Finally, hybrid
vehicles are assumed to use an electric engine up to a speed level of 30
km/h, beyond which the combustion engine is used.

The total noise level (in A-weighted decibels) is calculated using the
following equation:

.. math:: L_{W,\ dBA} = 10*\log\left( 10^{\frac{L_{W,R}}{10}} \right) + 10*log(10^{\frac{L_{W,P}}{10}})

The total sound power level is converted into Watts (or joules per
second), using the following equation:

.. math:: L_{W} = \ 10^{- 12}*10^{\frac{L_{W,\ dBA}}{10}}

The total sound power, for each second of the driving cycle, is then
distributed between the urban, suburban and rural inventory emission
compartments.

:ref:`Figure 15 <figure-15>` illustrates a comparison of noise levels between an ICEV and
BEV as calculated by the tool, over the driving cycle WLTC. In this
figure, the noise levels at different frequency ranges have been summed
together to obtain a total noise level (in dB), and converted to dB(A)
using the A-weighting correction factor, to better represent the
"loudness" or discomfort to the human ear. Typically, propulsion noise
emissions dominate in urban environments (which corresponds to the
`Road demand`_ section of the driving cycle), thereby justifying the use of
electric vehicles in that regard. This is represented by the difference
between the ICEV and BEV lines in the `Road demand`_ section of the driving cycle
in :ref:`Figure 15 <figure-15>`. The difference in noise level between the two
powertrains diminishes at higher speed levels (see `Fuel properties`_, `Exhaust emissions`_ and
`Non-exhaust emissions`_) as rolling noise emissions dominate above a speed level of
approximately 50 km/h. This can be seen in :ref:`Figure 16 <figure-16>`, which sums up
the sound energy produced, in joules, over the course of the driving cycle.

The study from :cite:`ct-1015` provides compartment-specific
noise emission characterization factors against midpoint and endpoint
indicators - expressed in Person-Pascal-second and Disability-Adjusted
Life Year, respectively.

Electricity mix calculation
***************************

Electricity supply mix are calculated based on the weighting from the
distribution the lifetime kilometers of the vehicles over the years of
use. For example, should a BEV enter the fleet in Poland in 2020, most
LCA models of passenger vehicles would use the electricity mix for
Poland corresponding to that year, which corresponds to the row of the
year 2020 in :ref:`Table 24 <table-24>`, based on ENTSO-E's TYNDP 2020 projections
(National Trends scenario) :cite:`ct-1120`. ``carculator`` calculates instead the
average electricity mix obtained from distributing the annual kilometers
driven along the vehicle lifetime, assuming an equal number of
kilometers is driven each year. Therefore, with a lifetime of 200,000 km
and an annual mileage of 12,000 kilometers, the projected electricity
mixes to consider between 2020 and 2035 for Poland are shown in :ref:`Table 24 <table-24>`.
Using the kilometer-distributed average of the projected mixes
between 2020 and 2035 results in the electricity mix presented in the
last row of :ref:`Table 24 <table-24>`. The difference in terms of technology contribution
and unitary GHG-intensity between the electricity mix of 2020 and the
electricity mix based on the annual kilometer distribution is
significant (-23%). The merit of this approach ultimately depends on
whether the projections will be realized or not.

It is also important to remember that the unitary GHG emissions of each
electricity-producing technology changes over time, as the background
database ecoinvent has been transformed by premise :cite:`ct-1121`: for example,
photovoltaic panels become more efficient, as well as some of the
combustion-based technologies (e.g., natural gas). For more information
about the transformation performed on the background life cycle
database, refer to :cite:`ct-1121`.

Inventories for fuel pathways
*****************************

A number of inventories for fuel production and supply are used by
``carculator``. They represent an update in comparison to the inventories
used in the passenger vehicles model initially published by :cite:`ct-1012`.
The fuel pathways presented in :ref:`Table 25 <table-25>` are from the literature
and not present as generic ecoinvent datasets.

Life cycle impact assessment
----------------------------

To build the inventory of every vehicle, ``carculator`` populates a
three-dimensional array ``A`` (i.e., a tensor) such as:

.. math:: \ A = \left\lbrack a_{\text{ijk}} \right\rbrack,\ i = 1,\ \ldots,\ L,\ j = 1,\ \ldots,\ M,\ k = 1,\ \ldots,\ N

The second and third dimensions (i.e., ``M`` and ``N``) have the same
length. They correspond to product and natural flow exchanges between
supplying activities (i.e., ``M``) and receiving activities (i.e., ``N``).
The first dimension (i.e., ``L``) stores model iterations. Its length
depends on whether the analysis is static or if an uncertainty analysis
is performed (e.g., Monte Carlo).

Given a final demand vector ``f`` (e.g., 1 kilometer driven with a
specific vehicle, represented by a vector filled with zeroes and the
value 1 at the position corresponding to the index ``j`` of the driving
activity in dimension M) of length equal to that of the second dimension
of ``A`` (i.e., ``M``), ``carculator`` calculates the scaling factor ``s`` so
that:

.. math:: s = A^{- 1}f

Finally, the scaling factor ``s`` is multiplied with a characterization
matrix ``B``. This matrix contains midpoint characterization factors for a
number of impact assessment methods (as rows) for every activity in ``A``
(as columns).

As described earlier, the tool chooses between several
characterization matrices ``B``, which contain pre-calculated values for
activities for a given year, depending on the year of production of the
vehicle as well as the REMIND climate scenario considered (i.e.,
"SSP2-Baseline", "SSP2-PkBudg1150" or "SSP2-PkBudg500"). Midpoint and
endpoint (i.e., human health, ecosystem impacts and resources use)
indicators include those of the ReCiPe 2008 v.1.13 impact assessment
method, as well as those of EF 3.1. Additionally, it is possible to
export the inventories in a format compatible with the LCA framework
`Brightway2 <https://brightway.dev/>`_ or `SimaPro <https://simapro.com/>`_,
thereby allowing the characterization of the results against a larger number of impact assessment methods.
